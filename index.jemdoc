== About me
<<<<<<< HEAD
I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Data Science, City University of Hong Kong. Before joining CityU, I was a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Biostatistics at Yale University under the supervision of Prof. [https://publichealth.yale.edu/people/heping_zhang.profile Heping Zhang]. My current research interests focus on imaging data analysis, high-dimensional statistics, and empirical Bayes methods. I obtained my Ph.D in Statistics from Rutgers University, and advised by Prof. [https://stat.rutgers.edu/home/cunhui/ Cun-Hui Zhang] and Prof. [https://stat.rutgers.edu/home/ldicker/Home.html Lee Dicker].
